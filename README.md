## Overview

**LineaVote** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Linea Layer 2 Ethereum network. It enables users to create voting proposals and participate in voting on existing proposals. The application leverages React, TypeScript, and Vite for the frontend, and integrates with Ethereum via the WAGMI library for a seamless Web3 experience.

## Features

- **Decentralized:** All votes and proposals are stored on the Linea Layer 2 Ethereum network.
- **Secure and Transparent:** Voting data is securely signed and stored on verified contracts.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite:** A fast development build tool for modern web projects.
- **WAGMI:** A React Hooks library for Ethereum, providing easy-to-use hooks for interacting with the blockchain.
